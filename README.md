This is the Javascript patch file for the Opera ["Fix the Web"](http://github.com/cyberstream/Fix-the-Web) extension.

Before applying a patch to a web page, contact the owner of that website, inform them about the problem, and request that they fix it. If your request is ignored or turned down, then you may resort to applying a patch to the web page with this script. 

Remember, our top priority is to fix the web for everyone, not just the users of this extension through this patch script.
